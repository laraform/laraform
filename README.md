## Installation

Laraform is a full-stack library which comes with a separate frontend and backend library. This will install Laraform's Community Edition. For the full package please [check out our website](https://laraform.io/pricing).

Install frontend library for Vue.js:

``` bash
npm i laraform --save
```

Make sure you have the following peer dependencies installed:

```
npm i axios lodash moment vue --save
```

Install backend library for Laravel:

``` bash
composer require laraform/laraform-laravel
```

Publish assets:
``` bash
php artisan vendor:publish
```

When asked, choose: `Laraform\LaraformServiceProvider`. This will publish a config file at `config/laraform.php`.

## Usage

Create a form at `app\Forms\FirstForm.php`:

``` php
<?php

namespace App\Forms;

class FirstForm extends \Laraform
{
  public function schema() {
    return [
      'hello_world' => [
        'type' => 'text',
        'label' => 'Hello',
        'default' => 'World'
      ]
    ];
  }
}
```

Pass the form to view in `routes/web.php` using `app()` function:

``` php
Route::get('/', function () {
  return view('welcome', [
    'form' => app('App\Forms\FirstForm')
  ]);
});
```

Set up rendering in view in `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">

    <title>Laravel</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/app.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app">
      {!! $form->render() !!}
    </div>

    <script src="/js/app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Include `Laraform` in `resources/js/app.js`:

``` javascript
require('./bootstrap');

import Vue from 'vue'
import Laraform from 'laraform'

Vue.use(Laraform)

const app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
})
```

Import theme in `resources/sass/app.scss`:

``` scss
@import 'laraform/src/themes/default/scss/theme.scss';
```

If you are planning to use a CSS framework, like Bootstrap, make sure you include its theme file **before** Laraform's theme, so that Laraform can make use of the CSS framework's variables.

This is how it should look like in case of Bootstrap 4:

``` scss
// Bootstrap 4's main theme file
@import 'bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';

// Laraform's theme file created for Bootstrap 4
@import 'laraform/src/themes/bs4/scss/theme.scss';
```

Laraform currently support Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4. **If you are using one of those also make sure to change the global `theme` in  `config/laraform.php` to `bs3` or `bs4`:**

``` php
// ...
'theme' => 'bs4',

// ...
```

Compile your assets with:

``` bash
npm run dev
```

Launch your site for example with:

``` bash
php artisan serve
```

Now if you load the site you should see a very simple form with one single input. Check out our [docs](https://laraform.io/docs) to learn how to create more advanced forms.

You can also download [Examples](https://github.com/laraform/examples) to see more forms in action.
